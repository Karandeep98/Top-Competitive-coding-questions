Another Approach to find Longest Palindrome Substring of String using Longest Common Subsequence.

Step-1 : Find the reverse of the input string.

Step-2 : Now print the Longest Common Subsequence between the original string and reversed string.

This approach will take O(n*n) time complexity and same space complexity.
